This is an pbl project for Software Engineering.
Led By Mehdi Zaidi and contributers include Kirri Tharun, Tushar Dwivedi and Piyush Pal.
This Project implements a custom shell for linux using the readline library from GNU.

NOTE: This code will run only on UNIX/LINUX systems so either install WSL on your windows or use a VM with ubuntu.

1. Install GNU's readLine library using:-
                                            sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev        (linux)

2. After its finished installing, your system is now ready to run readLine library function.

3. For running test.c, you can just execute the a.out file using:-
                                                                    ./a.out
4. And if you want to make changes and compile test.c then:-
                                                                gcc test.c -lreadline -lcurses
This line adds linkage with the GNU Readline library. I have made use of readline() and add_history() functions, which are part of the readline library, which cannot be used without linking it during compilation.
